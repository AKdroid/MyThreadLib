<h3>Description:</h3>
Implement a non pre-emptive user-level threads library
<i>mythread.a</i> with 
the following routines.

<h4>Thread routines.</h4>
<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><em>MyThread <strong>MyThreadCreate</strong>
      (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)</em>
  </dt><dd>This routine creates a new <em>MyThread</em>.
      The parameter <em>start_func</em> is the function in which the
      new thread starts executing.
      The parameter <em>args</em> is passed to the start function.
      This routine does <em>not</em> pre-empt the invoking thread.
      In others words the parent (invoking) thread will continue to
      run; the child thread will sit in the ready queue.
  </dd><dt><em>void <strong>MyThreadYield</strong>(void)</em>
  </dt><dd>Suspends execution of invoking thread and yield to another thread.
      The invoking thread  remains ready to execute—it is not
      blocked.
      Thus, if there is no other ready thread, the invoking thread will
      continue to execute.
  </dd><dt><em>int <strong>MyThreadJoin</strong>(MyThread thread)</em>
  </dt><dd>Joins the invoking function with the specified child thread.
      If the child has already terminated, do not block.
      Note: A child may have terminated without the parent having
      joined with it.
      Returns 0 on success (after any necessary blocking).
      It returns -1 on failure.
      Failure occurs if specified thread is not an immediate
      child of invoking thread.
  </dd><dt><em>void <strong>MyThreadJoinAll</strong>(void)</em>
  </dt><dd>Waits until all children have terminated.
      Returns immediately if there are no <em>active</em> children.
  </dd><dt><em>void <strong>MyThreadExit</strong>(void)</em>
  </dt><dd>Terminates the invoking thread.  <em><strong>Note:</strong></em>
      all <em>MyThread</em>s are required to invoke this function.
      Do not allow functions to “fall out” of the start
      function.
</dd></dl>
</blockquote>
<h4>Semaphore routines.</h4>
<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt><em>MySemaphore <strong>MySemaphoreInit</strong>(int initialValue)</em>
  </dt><dd>Create a semaphore.
      Set the initial value to <em>initialValue</em>, which must be
      non-negative.
      A positive initial value has the same effect as invoking
      <em>MySemaphoreSignal</em> the same number of times.
  </dd><dt><em>void <strong>MySemaphoreSignal</strong>(MySemaphore sem)</em>
  </dt><dd>Signal semaphore <em>sem</em>.
      The invoking thread is not pre-empted.
  </dd><dt><em>void <strong>MySemaphoreWait</strong>(MySemaphore sem)</em>
  </dt><dd>Wait on semaphore <em>sem</em>.
  </dd><dt><em>int <strong>MySemaphoreDestroy</strong>(MySemaphore sem)</em>
  </dt><dd>Destroy semaphore <em>sem</em>.
      Do not destroy semaphore if any threads are blocked on the
      queue.
      Return 0 on success, -1 on failure.
</dd></dl>
</blockquote>
<h4>Unix process routines.</h4>
The Unix process in which the user-level threads run is not a
<em>MyThread</em>.
Therefore, it will not be placed on the queue of
<em>MyThreads.</em>
Instead it will create the first <em>MyThread</em> and relinquish the
processor to the <em>MyThread</em> engine. 
<p>
The following routine may be executed only by the Unix process.

</p><blockquote>
<dl>      
  <dt><em>void <strong>MyThreadInit</strong>
      (void(*start_funct)(void *), void *args)</em>
  </dt><dd>This routine is called before any other <em>MyThread</em> call.
      It is invoked only by the Unix process.
      It is similar to invoking <em>MyThreadCreate</em> immediately
      followed by  <em>MyThreadJoinAll</em>.
      The <em>MyThread</em> created is the oldest ancestor of all
      <em>MyThread</em>s—it is the
      “main” <em>MyThread</em>.
      This routine can only be invoked once.
      It returns when there are no threads available to run (i.e.,
      the thread ready queue is empty.
</dd></dl>
</blockquote>

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use a FIFO (first-in, first-out) scheduling policy for threads
      on the ready queue.
  </li><li>Make all the routines available via a library.  Use the
      <em>ar</em> command to make a library.
      It will be used similar to this:
      <blockquote>
      <kbd>
      ar rcs mythread.a file1.o file2.o file3.o
      </kbd>
      </blockquote>
  </li><li>All programs that use this library will include
      a header file (<em>mythread.h</em>) that defines all the
      interfaces and data structures 
      that are needed—but no more.
  </li><li>This library does not have to be <em>thread-safe</em> and will 
      only execute in a single-threaded (OS) process.
      Assume that an internal thread operation cannot be
      interrupted by another thread operation.
      (E.g., <em>MyThreadExit</em> will not be interrupted by
      <em>MyThreadYield</em>.)
      That means that the library does not have to acquire locks to
      protect the <strong>internal</strong> data of the thread library.
      (A user may still have to acquire semaphores to protect user
      data.)
  </li><li>The interface only allows one parameter (a <strong>void
      *</strong>) to be passed to a <em>MyThread</em>.
      This is sufficient.
      One can build wrapper functions that <em>pack</em> and
      <em>unpack</em> an arbitrary parameter list into an object
      pointed to by a <strong>void *</strong>.
      This <a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/merge.c">program</a> gives an example of that.
      It is not a complete program—some of the logic is absent.
      It is only provided to illustrate how to use the interface.
  </li><li>Allocate at least 8KB for each thread stack.
      
</li></ul>

<h3>Turn In:</h3>
Be sure to turnin <b>all</b> the files needed.
Include a <tt>Makefile</tt> that creates a library (a
".a" file) called <tt>mythread.a</tt>.
An appropriate penalty will be assessed if this is not so.
<p>
Also, denote any resources used--including other students--in a file
named <b>REFERENCES</b>.

</p><hr>

<h3>Resources:</h3>

Here is the <a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/mythread.h">header</a> file for the library.
This file is the <em>de facto</em> interface for the library.
<b>Do not edit it.</b>
<p>
Additionally, here is a <a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/fib.c">program</a> that uses the
library.
<strong>The program comes with no warranty at all.</strong>
It is provided as an illustration only.
</p><p>
Some <a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/mythread.pdf">slides</a> describing the assignment.

<h3>Testing:</h3>
This assignment will be compiled and tested
on a VCL Linux machine.

<hr>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ol>
<li> 
    <b>Do not</b> use the <i>pthread</i> library or any
    similar threading package.
</li><li>
  Instead use the “context”
    routines: <em>getcontext(2), setcontext(2), makecontext(3)</em>,
    and <em>swapcontext(3)</em>
</li><li>
    During testing many processes (or threads) will be created on
    machines used by others.
    Take care when testing.
  </li><li><a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/mythread_tests.tar.gz">Test programs</a>
  Here are four example test cases.
  We think they are correct.
  However, there is no warranty.
  Alert us if you find any mistakes.
  We will use many more test cases during grading; do not let success
  on these codes lull you in to complacency. 
  </li>
  <li>
  The code will be tested on the VCL image named 
  <a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/wrap/assignments/submit.html">here.</a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Grading:</h3>
The weighting of this assignment is given in
<a href="https://courses.ncsu.edu/csc501/lec/001/policies.html#grading">policies</a>. 

<h4>Extra Credit</h4>
Extra credit of 5% is available.
Two restrictions were designed into the assignment to keep it simple:
(1) Each thread must end in <i>MyThreadExit</i> and
(2) The initial "UNIX" process context is not used as a thread context.
To receive the extra credit, students must provide the following
work-arounds to those restrictions.
Specifically, the library must do the following.
<ol>
  <li>Work correctly when threads do not end with <i>MyThreadExit</i>.</li>
  <li>Create a rountine <i>int MyThreadInitExtra(void)</i> that initializes the
  threads package <b>and</b> converts the UNIX process context into a
  MyThread context. 
  <blockquote>
  <pre>  ...

  MyThreadInitExtra(...);
  // code here runs in thread context.
  // it is the root or "oldest ancestor" thread
  MyThreadCreate(...); // Creates a new thread
  MyThreadYield(...);  // Yield to new thread just created

  ...
  </pre>
  </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
  Submit a second header file (mythreadextra.h) that contains
  everything in the original header plus the definition of
  MyThreadInitExtra().
  </li>
